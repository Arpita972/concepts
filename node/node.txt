When functions can be treated like any other variable then those functions are first-class functions. 
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments (callbacks) or return functions as their results. Higher-order functions include:
•	Map
•	Sort
•	filter
What is Node.js?
Node JS is a server-side scripting mainly written on Google v8 engine it is widely used for web application for file reading writing and calling rest APIs.
Why use Google v8?
Node use Google v8 is chrome runtime engine which convert JavaScript code into native machine code so it provides a fast running application.    
How it works?
•	Clients Send request to Web Server.
•	Node JS Web Server receives those requests and places them into a Queue. It is known as “Event Queue”.
•	Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop
•	Event Loop uses Single Thread only
•	Event Loop checks any Client Request is placed in Event Queue. If no, then wait for incoming requests for indefinitely.
•	If yes, then pick up one Client Request from Event Queue
•	Starts process that Client Request
•	If that Client Request Does Not requires any Blocking IO Operations, then process everything, prepare response and send it back to client.
•	If that Client Request requires some Blocking IO Operations like interacting with Database, File System, External Services then it will follow different approach
	Checks Threads availability from Internal Thread Pool
	Picks up one Thread and assign this Client Request to that thread.
	That Thread is responsible for taking that request, process it, perform Blocking IO operations, prepare response and send it back to the Event Loop
	Event Loop in turn, sends that Response to the respective Client.


 REPL:
•	Read: It reads the inputs from users and parses it into JavaScript data structure. It is then stored to memory.
•	Eval: The parsed JavaScript data structure is evaluated for the results.
•	Print: The result is printed after the evaluation.
•	Loop: Loops the input command. To come out of NODE REPL
